python driver to control schunk device through serial.
Similar to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SchunkMotionProtocol/
but opens connection only once and supports impulses. It can also control a device
through a tcp connection (need extra hardware)

Is is not very well documented but very simpe. Look at the two example files and the very few
exposed methods of the device object.
